## Thyroid cancer is becoming a growing health concern, especially in high-income countries. Recent studies indicate that in India, the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased by 62% in women and 48% in men over the past decade, particularly affecting younger individuals under 45. A major reason for this surge is over-diagnosis, where cases are detected that might not have caused harm in a personâ€™s lifetime. This leads to unnecessary treatments, increased medical costs, and patient anxiety.Given the rising cases and the need for accurate diagnosis, I wanted to build a machine learning-based thyroid disease prediction system. The goal was to help in early detection and reduce misdiagnosis, ensuring that only high-risk cases receive medical intervention. By using ML, we can improve diagnostic accuracy, helping doctors make more data-driven decisions and potentially reducing over-diagnosis cases."
